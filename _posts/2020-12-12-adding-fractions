Probably in school you learned that
$$ \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+bc}{bd}. $$

When I was an undergraduate, a professor asked me why fraction addition had this rather funny looking definition. Why not just define it this way?
$$ \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d}. $$

Well, obviously, because it doesn't work. If I buy a pizza, give my mother half of it, and my father a quarter, well, I've given away three-fourths of the pizza, not one-sixth. What a silly question!
