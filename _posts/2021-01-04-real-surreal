In my [last post](https://pranavchinmay.github.io/adding-fractions/), I described the first "expansion" of numbers most of us encounter: going from the set of integers, $$\mathbb{Z}$$ $$(...,-1,0,1,...)$$, to the set of fractions, or **rational numbers**, $$\mathbb{Q}$$. The introduction of rational numbers was motivated by the following question. What do you multiply $$5$$ by to get $$1$$? In the set $$\mathbb{Q}$$, this question has an answer---$$\frac{1}{5}$$. One might imagine, now, that this set $\mathbb{Q}$ contains sufficiently many numbers to handle whatever questions we may throw at it.

But it doesn't. What number, when multiplied by itself, gives $$2$$? Let us give it a symbol: $$\sqrt{2}$$. Now, is $$\sqrt{2}$$ a rational number? Does it live in $$\mathbb{Q}$$?

This is an old question, with an old [proof](https://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/math/q1.html). No. The number we have labelled $$\sqrt{2}$$ is not a rational number. We need a larger set of numbers to deal with such questions. This is the set of **real numbers**, denoted $$\mathbb{R}$$. Okay, good, but what does this look like: what properties does it have? Our reference point is $$\mathbb{Q}$$, so let's go from there. The two primary properties of the rational numbers, $$\mathbb{Q}$$, are the following: 
(i) they are **totally ordered**---given any two rationals, $$a$$ and $$b$$, at least one of the following happens: $$a \leq b$$, or $$b \leq a$$, 
(ii) they form a **field**---you can add, subtract, and multiply rational numbers, and divide by nonzero rational numbers. 

The questions, now, are the following: do these two properties extend to $$\mathbb{R}$$? Does $$\mathbb{R}$$ have any other properties?

Let's tackle (i) first. If the reals are to be totally ordered, we will need to know how big this "$$\sqrt{2}$$" is. Our intuition tells us to note that $$1.4^2 = 1.96$$, and $$1.5^2 = 2.25$$, so this thing we have called "$$\sqrt{2}$$", whose square is $$2$$, should be larger than $$1.4$$ and smaller than $$1.5$$. Next, $$1.41^2 = 1.9881$$, and $$1.42^2 = 2.0164$$, so $$\sqrt{2}$$ should be larger than $$1.41$$, and smaller than $$1.42$$. We can continue this process indefinitely,
